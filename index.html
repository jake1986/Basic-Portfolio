      <p>My name is Jake Rhoads. I have been a middle school Spanish teacher for the past 3 years, however I have
        decided to leave that career path to pursue something in the technology field. I love to learn languages. Beyond
        Spanish, I speak Portuguese and I am learning Italian. I decided to learn Portuguese because it is so similar to
        Spanish. I also had a brief stay in Brazil where I taught English and continued to improve my Portuguese. </p>

      <p>I have a brother named Daniel who lives in Spain with his wife Silvia. They live in the city of Barcelona.
        Silvia is Italian and is from Rome. That is one of the reasons why I decided to learn Italian. My brother is
        becoming very proficient in Italian and I would like to be able to acquire the same skill. We really enjoy to
        spend time together. During the summer of 2019 I stayed in Spain for 2 months and Dan, Silvia, and I traveled to
        Germany together for 9 days. We visited Munich and Berlin. It was an unforgettable experience for all 3 of us.
